Once this transition is complete, users can then migrate content from Pages Router to App Router.

If you're looking for details, we&nbsp;have <a href=""https://github.com/chapter-three/next-drupal/tree/main/examples/example-router-migration#readme"">documented the migration process</a> on Github.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>MPROVED DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE</strong></h2><p>Next-Drupal 2.0 does more than make your site faster. It also provides a better developer experience through a new feature called Draft Mode, which replaces the old Preview Mode.</p><p>Draft mode solves the issue of having to rebuild the entire Next.js application when you've only edited a small portion of content. Draft Mode allows the Drupal server to connect to the Next.js app and say ""just show me this new piece of content,"" without doing the whole rebuild.</p><p>As with the transition from Pages Router to App Router, Next-Drupal 2.0 enables Draft Mode support without removing Preview Mode support.</p>|basic_html|<p>Remember Next-Drupal?

Some key improvements in the editing experience include:</p><p><strong>Improved WYSIWYG Editor</strong><br>Drupal 10 features a new <a href=""https://blog.hubspot.com/website/best-wysiwyg-html-editor"">WYSIWYG editor</a> that provides a more modern and user-friendly interface for editing content. The editor is designed to be more intuitive, with improved toolbar options, a more responsive layout, and a simpler interface.</p><p><strong>Better Inline Editing</strong><br>Drupal 10 introduces a new inline editing feature that allows users to edit content directly from the site’s front end without navigating to the back end.

This includes tracking changes, reviewing and approving content, and managing workflows.</p><h2 id=""Deprecations"">Deprecations &amp; Changes</h2><p>In addition to the improved features, Drupal 10 has also introduced some deprecations and changes. The main ones include</p><h3 id=""Decoupled-Menus"">Decoupled Menus</h3><p>Decoupled Menus refer to a concept where the menu presentation layer is separated from the back-end management layer. This means that the menu data is stored and managed in Drupal but displayed on the front-end using a separate JavaScript framework such as React, Vue, or Angular.</p><p>This approach allows for greater flexibility and improved performance in the front-end menu presentation. To implement decoupled menus in Drupal 10, you will need to use a decoupled menu module or build a custom solution that integrates with Drupal’s menu management API.</p><h3 id=""Removed-Deprecated-Code"">Removed Deprecated Code</h3><p>Removed Deprecated Code refers to the process of removing old, <a href=""https://www.cloudways.com/blog/speed-up-drupal-performance/"">unused code from the Drupal</a> core that is no longer supported and could potentially cause compatibility issues with future updates.</p><p>The removal of deprecated code helps to improve the performance, stability, and security of Drupal, as well as make it easier for developers to maintain and update their sites.</p><p>In Drupal 10, deprecated code has been removed and replaced with updated, supported APIs and features, which can provide improved functionality and better performance.</p><p>Additionally, this helps maintain compatibility with modern web development practices, making Drupal 10 a more robust and up-to-date platform for building websites.</p><h3 id=""Removed-Core-Modules"">Removed Core Modules</h3><p>Some core modules have been removed in an effort to streamline the platform and improve the performance of Drupal 10.</p><p>The removed modules are either deprecated or have limited use cases, and their functionality can be replaced with other modules or custom code. Some of the removed modules in Drupal 10 include:</p><p><strong>Overlay</strong><br>This module was used for displaying administrative pages in a modal window, but it has been replaced by more modern approaches, such as using the administrative toolbar or JavaScript libraries.</p><p><strong>Workspaces</strong><br>This module provided a way to manage multiple website configurations, but it was not widely used and has been replaced by other solutions.</p><p><strong>PHP Filter</strong><br>This module provided a way to embed <a href=""https://www.cloudways.com/blog/how-to-start-with-php/"">PHP code</a> within content, but it posed a security risk and has been replaced by other options, such as custom modules or third-party modules.</p><p>By removing these modules, Drupal 10 provides a more streamlined and focused platform that can be more easily maintained and updated while reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.</p><h2 id=""How-to-Upgrade-to-Drupal-10"">How to Upgrade to Drupal 10</h2><p>Upgrading to Drupal 10 is a major process that requires careful planning, preparation, testing, and optimization.

The organizations you trust most. The software they depend on.</h2><h3>Make something amazing, for anyone</h3><p>Drupal is content management software. It's used to make many of the websites and applications you use every day. Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need.</p><p>It's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable.</p><p>The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others.

The organizations you trust most. The software they depend on.</h2><h3>Make something amazing, for anyone</h3><p>Drupal is content management software. It's used to make many of the websites and applications you use every day. Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need.</p><p>It's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable.</p><p>The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"">GNU General Public License</a> (GPL). There are <a href=""https://www.drupal.org/about/licensing"">no licensing fees</a>, ever.
